# ExiledCrab's Reactable Debuff Overlay for PoE
Reactable Debuff Overlay is a tool to help people (like me) who already had a ton of trouble taking care of debuffs in Path of Exile. With the new nerfs to flasks, piano-flasking to keep up immunity is gone.

GGG stated that they wanted debuffs and flasks to be a 'reaction' mechanic, and not a spam mechanic. This is totally fine until you realize that some people have trouble figuring out which specfic debuff they have in a reasonable amount of time due to UI clutter and no customization.

If that sounds like you, then this tool is for you!

## IMPORTANT THINGS
1. This is a tool to package information already available in the UI into an easier to digest format
2. This tool lets you play PoE the way GGG says they want you to without any headaches
3. This tool will NEVER ALLOW ANY TYPE OF AUTOMATION OF GAME MECHANICS
4. This tool will NEVER PLAY ANY ASPECT OF THE GAME FOR YOU

## How Does It Look?

If you have none of these 5 debuffs (bleed, freeze, ignite, poison, shock) then you see nothing! Here's an image with all of them showing as if you were affected by them

## Current Caveats
* You MUST play PoE in `windowed` or `windowed fullscreen` graphics mode
* only tested to work on 1920x1080 resolution (what i play at, scaling is next thing that I'll be building out)
* Current performance isn't great. It updates about 7-8 times a second and your FPS takes a bit of a hit. (My potato machine is still above 100fps on avg but YMMV)
* No customization unless you like programming, another thing that I want to add in the future
* This was made in a couple hours, it shows lul
